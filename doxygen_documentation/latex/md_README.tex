QUantum Electron Simulation Toolbox (QUEST) is a Fortran 90/95 package that implements the Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method for quantum electron simulations. The original versions of DQMC programs, developed by the condensed matter theory group at UCSB including R. L Sugar, D. J. Scalapino, S. R. White, and E. Y. Loh, and maintained by R. Scalettar, have been extensively used to study magnetism, metal-\/insulator transitions, and superconductivity by the Hubbard model.

Wei-\/\+Ting Chiu, Yuxi Zhang, and Richard Scalettar are developing a new version of QUEST which will extend its capabilities to electron-\/phonon models including the Holstein and Su-\/\+Schrieffer-\/\+Heeger Hamiltonians.

For the algorithm and electron-\/phonon model Hamiltonians, please refer to ar\+Xiv\+:1809.\+07902 and ar\+Xiv\+:1712.\+04072.
